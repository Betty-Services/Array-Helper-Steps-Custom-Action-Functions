## This repository hosts the following steps:

- Create Array
- Includes
- Index Of
- Remove Element
- Add Element
- Slice
- Array Loop
- Count

### Create Array

The output is currently an `Object` but will be changed to `Array` once the feature is available.

### Includes

This actionstep let's you test whether a value is in an array
Returns `true` if the element was found, otherwise it will return `false`.

This actionstep lets you find the position of the element in an array.
Arrays start as `0`.

If there was no match, this step will return `-1`.

### Remove Element

This action step removes an element from an array.

The output is currently an `Object` but will be changed to `Array` once the feature is available.

### Add Element

This action step adds an element to an array.

The output is currently an `Object` but will be changed to Array once the feature is available.

### Slice

This action step returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, selected from `start` to `end` (`end` not included) where `start` and `end` represent the index of elements in that array.

The output is currently an `Object` but will be changed to Array once the feature is available.

### Array Loop

This action step lets you loop over the elements in an array.

### Count

This action step lets you count the amount of elements in an array.
